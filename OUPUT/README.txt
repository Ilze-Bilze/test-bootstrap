====================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
1. No CSS library such as Bootstrap or Foundation been used for this exercise
  Since I couldn't use any of the frameworks, the layout has been done using flex box.

2. No Javascript (or related libraries) been used

3. Pay attention to details for the Design when converting into HTML: 
  This probably was the hardest part, except trying to run Gulp. For some reason I could not get that working, till I realised that I was on old node version (having more then one version for older and newer websites on my machine). I don't have Photoshop or Indesign apps on my computer, so the spacing and font sizes and colours I've been guessing. Plus it's JPG, hard to tell what the actual width of the site is. Left it 100% wide. Different styling for different screen sizes, in this case there are 3 (mobile, laptops 13" and larger screens then 1400px). Nothing for tablets. Don't think that was needed. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------------------
1. To understand your natural approach when building a web page

TASKS
------------
1. Based on the two visuals called DESKTOP & MOBILE, please convert the design
into a fully functional HTML document.
2. SASS should be used as your CSS preprocessor and a task runner such as GRUNT or GULP should be set up and include whatever tasks you feel are needed.
